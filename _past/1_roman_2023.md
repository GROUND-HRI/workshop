# Workshop Highlights


The 1st edition of the GROUND Workshop, held at the <a href="http://ro-man2023.org/main"><b>IEEE RO-MAN 2023</b> Conference</a>, concluded with flying colors! We managed to gather more than 70 researchers - either in person and through Zoom - interested in group-robot interaction!

Given the success of the workshop, we plan to organize future editions in other interantional conferences. If you want to be notified, please apply to the **[Let's Stay in Touch](/ground-workshop/attendance)**. We are also thinking about making a social network - aka. a GROUP - of researchers sharing the same interests.

Here are some feedback about group-robot interaction from the interactive sessions.
