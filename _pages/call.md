We encourage the submission of original contributions, presenting innovative strategies for exploring group-robot interactions, with approaches focused on - but not limited to – gamification; providing a fresh and insightful viewpoint on using social robots for understanding group dynamics, and designing social agents able to interact with groups. The contributions may include work in progress with preliminary results, technical reports, case studies, surveys and state-of-the-art research.

In particular, authors can submit:
* **Regular papers** (max. 8 including references);
* **Extended Abstracts** (2-4 + references);

Topics of interests include but are not limited to:
* Understanding group dynamics through the use of social robots.
* Designing social robots able to interact with groups.
* Gamification in multiparty human-robot interactions.
* Promoting natural communication, mutual understanding and trust in human-robot mixed groups.
* Exploring different robot’s roles (e.g., peer, teacher, helper or friend) in group interactions.
* Interdisciplinary collaborations between roboticists, game designers, psychologists, and sociologists.
* Novel experimental designs for conducting group-robot interaction research.
* Ethical considerations in researching group dynamics and potential biases or negative consequences.
* Adaptation and personalization to groups.
* Learning strategies for autonomous behaviors of robots in groups.
* Modelling, understanding and predicting group behaviors.

## Submission Procedure

Please submit your contribution on **[EasyChair]()**. Authors should use the predefined **[LateX]() or [Word]() templates**.

The submitted contribution must be written in **english** and do not need to be anonymized (single-blind review process). A panel of experts from relevant fileds will be asked to review the contributions, selecting the most relevant, novel, original and high-quality ones to be included in the workshop program. Authors of accepted submissions will invited to give an **oral presentation** of their work. Also, it will be offered the option of having their papers uploaded to a workshop-specific archive in an open-access repository (e.g., arXiv). Depending on the workshop impact and participation, the organizers may also consider proposing a Special Issue to a Journal to collect broader follow-up papers.
