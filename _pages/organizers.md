Her research aims at investigating how to develop cognitive architectures for social robots to promote better human-robot interactions (HRI) and foster robots’ autonomous learning and adaptive  behavior, with a particular focus on multiparty interactions. Her research interests also include artificial intelligence, trustworthy and assistive social robotics. She is also actively involved in outreach and educational events to bring robotics and AI topics closer to a young and broad audience.</div>

She’s about to defend her Ph.D. thesis in collaboration with the University of Genova, where she investigated implicit communication applied to object manipulation and its implication in human-robot interaction. She has also collaborated in studies on children-robot interaction both in lab settings and in the wild. She’s passionate about science communication and dissemination: she participated in many science outreach events, and she is a Young Ambassador for the Women&Tech association.</div>

Her research aims to investigate and improve the interaction between humanoid robots and groups of people. She believes that teaching robots how to deal with groups would be crucial to insert robotic devices into everyday life and could reveal fascinating insights into human group dynamics. Since 2020 she has been a Global Shaper in the Genoa Hub, of which she became Vice-Curator in July 2022. In 2017 she co-founded Ianua Studenti e Alumni, a student organization she was president of from 2020 to 2021.</div>
