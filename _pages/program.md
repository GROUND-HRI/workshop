			        With continued advances in computing, robots are becoming increasingly capable of performing physical tasks and engaging socially with people. As robots enter roles in food delivery, child tutoring, older adult assistance, and more, robots will engage both physically and socially with people, individually and in groups. This talk focuses on the potential ways that the social behavior of robots can both positively and negatively shape interactions between people within a group through human-robot interaction roles, supportive verbal statements, and ice-breaking questions. The implications of the work I will highlight the need for researchers and practitioners in HRI and robotics to consider deeply and to continue to research the potential impacts that a robot's behaviors have to shape important human-human interactions within a group.

				<div class="postcard__preview-txt"><b>Robots for Society: Enhancing Well-Being through Socio-Cultural Integration</b><br>
                Social robots have been successfully deployed in human-robot interaction settings, demonstrating socially acceptable behavior. Recently, social robots have begun to undertake tasks that replicate the role of a friend, fostering personal relationships through empathetic interactions that can ultimately enhance individual well-being. This presentation expands the concept of social robots to "robots for society," emphasizing their societal impact by integrating socio-cultural foundations into the current social robot context. Additionally, we will present our work on developing robots with social embedding focusing on group interactions in both school and hospital environments.

			        Humans thrive on positive social interactions, yet dominance, competence and inclusion issues can create hurdles.  Research suggests robots can support interactions between people.  However, for real-world applications and deployment, we need to develop autonomous social robots that can interact with multiple people and adapt to human-human dynamics.  This talk explores the importance of such adaptation, showcasing how robots using simple perception and rules can significantly shape interactions positively. To pave the way for more complex interactions, the talk delves into leveraging machine learning techniques like reinforcement learning and imitation learning. It will discuss how to implement these techniques while ensuring the robot acts appropriately throughout learning and deployment.
