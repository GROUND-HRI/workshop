excerpt: "Today, conversational systems are expected to handle conversations in multi-party settings, especially within Socially Assistive Robots (SARs). However, practical usability remains difficult as there are additional challenges to overcome, such as speaker recognition, addressee recognition, and complex turn-taking. In this paper, we present our work on a multi- party conversational system, which invites two users to play a trivia quiz game. The system detects usersâ€™ agreement or disagreement on a final answer and responds accordingly. Our evaluation includes both performance and user assessment results, with a focus on detecting user agreement. We have configured the system to be used on the ARI robot deployed in a hospital waiting area as part of the SPRING project."
