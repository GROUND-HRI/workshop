title: Towards the use of a social mediator robot in a school setting
subtitle: Sara Cooper and Randy Gomez
excerpt: "Social mediator robots have the potential to improve educational outcomes and promote student interaction. In order to promote conversation and debate between kids from different cultural backgrounds, this article suggests using the Haru robot as a social mediator. It does this by encouraging equal turn-taking, immersive entertainment activities, and a proactive attitude. As children develop trust, they become more proactive and engaged in contact. This study especially evaluates low- and high-level socio-emotional characteristics of the multi-user interaction."
